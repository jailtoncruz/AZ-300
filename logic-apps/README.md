# Logic Apps

Logic Apps helps you build solutions that integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations by automating tasks and business processes as workflows.

[Connectors for Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list)

Each time that the trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs the workflow's actions. These actions can also include data conversions and flow controls, such as conditional statements, switch statements, loops, and branching.

For business-to-business (B2B) workflows and seamless communication with Azure Logic Apps, you can enable enterprise integration scenarios with Microsoft's cloud-based solution, the Enterprise Integration Pack. Organizations can exchange messages electronically, even if they use different protocols and formats. The pack transforms different formats into a format that organizations' systems can interpret and process. Organizations can exchange messages through industry-standard protocols, including AS2, X12, and EDIFACT. You can also secure messages with both encryption and digital signatures

Why should you use enterprise integration?
With enterprise integration, you can store all your artifacts in one place â€“ your integration account.
You can build B2B workflows and integrate with third-party software-as-service (SaaS) apps, on-premises apps, and custom apps by using the Azure Logic Apps engine and all its connectors.
You can create custom code for your logic apps with Azure functions.
